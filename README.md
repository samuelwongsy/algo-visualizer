## Algorithm Visualizer

On a journey to learning React, I wanted to build an algorithm visualizer for path-finding algorithms. 

Check out the project at [samuelwongsy.github.io/algo-visualizer](https://samuelwongsy.github.io/algo-visualizer). Still a work in progress, will be updating as I learn more about React!
